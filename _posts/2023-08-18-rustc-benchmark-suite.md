In my [recent post]({% post_url 2023-07-30-optimizing-rust-ci-2023 %}) about the Rust compiler CI
(continuous integration) and benchmarking infrastructure, I have promised to write a blog post about
runtime benchmarks, which is a new addition to the benchmark suite of the Rust compiler. However, I
realized that before doing that, it might be a good idea to first describe how does the benchmark suite
actually work, what are its components and how is it used by the Rust compiler (`rustc`) developers,
to introduce the necessary context. So, runtime benchmarks will have to wait :laughing:, and instead
this post will try to introduce the current state of the Rust compiler benchmarking infrastructure.

I will attempt to describe the general concepts and the workflow used by `rustc` compiler developers
to measure and monitor the performance of the Rust compiler over time. The main focus will be on the
[`rustc-perf`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf) repository, which contains all the
infrastructure for Rust compiler benchmarks, and the so-called **perf.RLO**
[website](https://perf.rust-lang.org/), which hosts various dashboards, charts and comparisons that
we use daily to analyze the compiler's performance.

# Problem statement
To really start from the beginning, we should first explain the motivation that led to the creation
of the benchmark suite. One of the most common complaints about Rust is that Rust programs are
[slow](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2022/02/15/Rust-Survey-2021.html#challenges-ahead)
[to](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/why-is-my-rust-build-so-slow)
[compile](https://prev.rust-lang.org/en-US/faq.html#why-is-rustc-slow). I won't go into the reasons
why that is the case here (short version: `cargo` compiles the "whole world" from scratch and Rust
made several design decisions that favor runtime speed instead of compilation speed), but even though
I have some opinions on the definition of "being slow" (more on that below), the fact remains that
many Rust developers consider the compiler to be slow enough so that it represents a very real
bottleneck to their development workflow, which is a big issue that we cannot afford to ignore.

This issue has been known for a long time of course, and therefore a lot of effort
has been (and still is being!) expended to improve the performance of the compiler. More than five
years ago, an official working group called [wg-compiler-performance](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler#Compiler%20performance%20working%20group)
was [established](https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/rust-compiler-performance-working-group/6934). The
goal of this group is to continuously measure, monitor and improve the compilation times of Rust
crates, primarily by optimizing the compiler, by sometimes also e.g. by contributing changes to popular
Rust crates to make them faster to compile.

The thing that we are most interested in is how is the performance of `rustc` changing *over time*,
and in particular, **how do individual changes (pull requests) to the compiler affect its performance**.
We track these compilation performance changes using the `rustc-perf` infrastructure, which I will
describe in detail in this post, and look out for possible major regressions. However, this does not mean
that we ban all pull requests (PRs) that cause compilation time regressions! Sometimes, it is necessary
to accept such PRs, for example to fix a soundness hole in the compiler, or to make some
part of the compiler simpler and more maintainable for the future. We have to remember that while it
is very important, performance is not everything, and always has to be judged against other metrics[^assembly]!

[^assembly]: We could probably make the compiler faster by rewriting half of it in assembly, but Rust
    developers probably wouldn't be happy if it then took 10 years to implement a single new feature
    into the language :)

Continuously monitoring the performance of a compiler or a library is not a new idea of course, and
there are several other projects that employ this technique, such as
[`numpy`](https://haozeke.github.io/asv-numpy/), [`CPython`](https://github.com/faster-cpython/benchmarking-public),
[`PyPy`](https://speed.pypy.org/) or [`LLVM`](https://llvm-compile-time-tracker.com/). The general idea is to measure the performance of `X` on a defined
set of benchmarks continuously (e.g. after each commit), display the history of performance changes
in an intuitive way and ideally also immediately alert the developers when regressions appear.

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Aside: is the Rust compiler slow?</summary>

Probably… but compared to what?. To properly answer such a question, we must have some sort of baseline.
Nothing is ever slow on its own, it is always slow compared to *something else*. So, compared to a
language like Python, `rustc` is definitely *a lot slower*, because a Python program doesn't really
require a separate compilation step[^bytecode] and starts executing pretty much instantly. Of course,
in the case of Python, you will probably pay for this by having reduced runtime performance and a
higher chance of runtime errors, but that is another set of trade-offs that is not strictly related
to *compilation performance*.

[^bytecode]: Yes, I know, bytecode compilation and JIT and different interpreters… Let's not get into
    the weeds :)

Now, compared to a language like C++, which has much more similar runtime performance characteristics
to Rust, I think that the story is less clear-cut. I won't be doing any large-scale scientific measurements
here, or trying to pick a winner, but I consider it to be interesting to think about the differences
in design between these two languages, like:
- In C++, by default, a translation unit is a single source file, while in Rust it is a whole crate.
  So after performing a single change, you either recompile a single file[^headers] (C++) or a whole crate (Rust).
  Of course, incremental compilation can help speed this up dramatically, but it is still an important
  difference.
- When you compile a Rust project, it will typically compile all its dependencies *from scratch*,
  except for the Rust and C standard libraries (and "native", usually C or C++, dependencies).

  As a totally random and meaningless example, if I run `cargo install ripgrep --features pcre2`, it
  compiles `ripgrep` and all its ~70 dependencies (with optimizations) in ~17 seconds on my machine.
  If I compile [`ugrep`](https://github.com/Genivia/ugrep), a `ripgrep` competitor written in C++, it takes ~10 seconds.
  But that is just the compilation of `ugrep` itself! It didn't compile `libbz2`, `liblz4`, `liblzma5`,
  `libpcre2`, `libzstd1` nor `zlib1g`, all of which are `ugrep`'s dependencies and which were already
  precompiled on my system. These numbers are not really meaningful[^benchmark], but I consider it interesting to
  think about the amount of work the compiler is doing, in relation to its perceived speed. The benefit
  of the additional work that `rustc` is doing here (compiling everything from scratch) is of course
  that `ripgrep` can use dependencies from a central registry in a very easy way, which is notoriously not
  the case for C++.
- The Rust compiler is doing a lot of checking that most other mainstream languages don't perform,
  like borrow checking or trait resolving. Not to mention its (commonly praised!) diagnostics,
  which provide a lot of value to Rust developers, but that also cause some performance penalty.

[^headers]: Probably in addition to tens or hundreds of header files :)

[^benchmark]: No, *really*. Please ignore these compilation time numbers and don't make any conclusions
    out of them. This "benchmark" is surely apples vs oranges in many ways. I just wanted to demonstrate
    the difference between compiling everything from scratch and using precompiled dependencies that
    have to be provided via external means, which is not always that simple.

One thing that I like to think about in this area is throughput (how much lines of code can you compile
per second) vs latency (how long do you have to wait after performing a single code change). I think
that `rustc` is not that bad in terms of throughput. As shown above, you can compile a nontrivial
program (`ripgrep`) along with tens of dependencies, in under 20 seconds in release mode.
Even in CI scenarios, where full rebuilds are common, you can usually compile your crates in a reasonable
time using tools like [rust-cache](https://github.com/Swatinem/rust-cache) or [cargo-chef](https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef).

What I consider to be the biggest pain point of `rustc`'s performance, which you probably notice
immediately while using `rustc`, is the *latency*. It might not seem like a big deal to wait for a
few seconds until your program or tests are built or type-checked after performing a small change,
but this adds up quickly. For me personally, improving the latency of the compiler would really help
speed up my local development workflow considerably.

I guess that the point that I'm trying to make is this: *for the amount of work the Rust compiler is
doing* (compiling heavily optimized binaries using monomorphization, while providing an enormous set
of compile-time checks), I would argue that it is actually quite fast. Of course, this doesn't really
help Rust developers that have to stare at the terminal for X seconds or even minutes after running
`cargo build` or `cargo check` :) So we still have a lot of work to do. But enough of this mini-rant,
let's get back to measuring the performance of `rustc`.

</details>

# What do we want to measure?
To measure something, we first need to decide *what* do we want to measure. "Performance of
`rustc`" is a very broad term, after all. There are actually several things that `rustc-perf`
analyzes for a given **artifact** (a specific version/commit/build of `rustc`):
- **Compilation performance** How much resources (time, memory, …) does the artifact consume
when compiling Rust crates? Or, in simpler terms: how fast does it compile Rust code?
This is probably the most interesting statistic for Rust developers, and it will be the main
focus of this post.
- **Bootstrap time** How long does it take for this artifact to compile itself (its own source code)?
Since `rustc` is composed of a set of Rust crates, this can be seen as a subset of
*compilation performance*. Nevertheless, it is interesting to monitor it separately, because it is
also affected by source code changes that don't necessarily affect the performance of the compiler,
but that do affect the time required to compile it (like extracting, merging or removing `rustc_*`
crates within the compiler [workspace](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler)). This measure is of course also very important for `rustc`
developers, because it directly affects their iteration speed when working on the compiler.
- **Runtime performance** How fast/efficient are Rust programs compiled by this artifact? This part
is relatively new, and I will dedicate a whole blog post to it (Coming soon™).
- **Artifact size** How large are the individual components (libraries, binaries) of the artifact?
This is sometimes important for performance, but mainly it affects things like the size of toolchain
archives distributed by `rustup`.

As a sneak peek, [here](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2023-08-01&end=2023-08-10&stat=instructions%3Au)
you can see one specific comparison of these four statistics between two artifacts (two different
compiler versions). Note that in the rest of the post, I will primarily focus on compilation performance.

# Benchmarks
To measure the performance of the compiler, we need some benchmarks. In our case, each *compile-time
benchmark* is a single Rust workspace (i.e. either a single crate or multiple crates). When we perform
a performance analysis, we compile each benchmark with the analysed `rustc` artifact several times,
and measure various metrics that are interesting to us (I'll talk more about metrics and the
benchmarking process later in the post).

Currently, we have about fifty benchmarks, which form the *compile-time benchmark suite*. They are
divided into three categories:
- **Primary** These are the benchmarks on which we focus the most, because they represent real-world
Rust code that will be typically encountered by most Rust developers. These include crates like
`hyper`, `ripgrep`, `regex`, `syn`, `serde`, `diesel`, `cargo` or `clap`.
- **Secondary** These benchmarks contain more arcane and unusual Rust code, which stresses `rustc`
in various ways. They might not necessarily represent real-world code, but they are still useful to
detect issues like memory exhaustion, stack overflow or catastrophically long compilation times
(caused e.g. by some [accidentally quadratic](https://accidentallyquadratic.tumblr.com/) behavior)
that sometimes happen in edge cases. For example, there are benchmarks that contain
[deeply nested types](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/compile-benchmarks/deeply-nested-multi/src/lib.rs),
[very large arrays](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/compile-benchmarks/coercions/src/main.rs)
or [huge match expression](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/compile-benchmarks/match-stress/src/huge.rs#L8210).
Even though you will probably not encounter such code in the wild (although, sometimes a bit of
liberal macro usage can produce similar *horrors*), these stress tests can sometimes tell us when some
part of the compiler suddenly becomes much slower.

    There are also two secondary benchmarks (`helloworld-tiny` and `ripgrep-13.0.0-tiny`), which exist
    solely to monitor the size of a "minimal-sized" Rust executable, which is compiled with compiler
    flags that should favour small executable size.
- **Stable** This is a special category of benchmarks which are not used for "day-to-day" performance
comparisons, but rather for monitoring the long term trend of `rustc` compilation performance. We are
running these benchmarks for every released stable and beta version of `rustc`, going all the way
back to `1.28.0`. You can see the historical trend of these benchmarks in the
[dashboard](https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html). These benchmarks are called *stable*, because
we try not to modify them in any way[^stable], so that we have a historical baseline for comparing
amongst different stable versions of `rustc` over a long time period. This is in contrast to the
primary and secondary benchmarks, which are being rotated or updated from time to time, according to the
[benchmark update policy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/compile-benchmarks/README.md#benchmark-update-policy).

[^stable]: Unless they [stop compiling](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1629) on the
    *stable* `rustc` channel, which does happen sometimes, for example when an unsoundness hole or
    some UB is fixed in the language.

It is not always easy to decide if a benchmark should be included in the benchmark suite or not. We
try to keep a healthy mix of real-world benchmarks and stress tests, and also attempt not to have
too much overlap, as it's not very useful to have two secondary benchmarks that both stress e.g. trait
resolving in the same way.

We also want to keep the scope of the suite somewhat reasonable. You could ask why don't we e.g.
benchmark the most popular 1000 crates from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) or something like that.
Well, performing so many benchmarks would cause (at least) two problems:
- It would take a long time to execute the benchmarks. Currently, it already takes more than an hour
to run the full benchmark suite. Increasing this time increases the latency of finding out if a
PR/commit caused a perf. improvement or a regression, which can be a bottleneck for `rustc` developers.
The benchmarks are currently executed on a single machine, and we're already hitting the limits of
its benchmarking throughput.
- Having so much data would make it harder to make sense of the results. We frequently encounter
noise in the benchmark results, and the more benchmarks we would have, the bigger the danger of
false noisy signals creeping in would be. Furthermore, it would make it harder for us to understand
why has a perf. change happened. With our current suite, whose size is (in my opinion) relatively
reasonable, `rustc` developers that focus on the performance of the compiler are somewhat familiar
with the benchmarks, to the point that they can often guess what could have caused a regression just
by eyeballing the set of benchmarks that have been regressed. It would be much harder to build and
exercise this knowledge if we had e.g. a thousand benchmarks.

If you want to examine the existing benchmarks in more detail, you can find the list of the currently
used compile-time benchmarks along with their descriptions
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/compile-benchmarks).

# Benchmark configurations
There are various workflows and corresponding expectations arising when compiling Rust code. Some
Rust developers care only about the performance of type checking (`cargo check`), e.g. to provide
quick feedback in their IDE. Some developers want really fast incremental debug builds, e.g. to
repeatedly re-run tests after making small changes to the code. And others want to have really fast
optimized builds, because the runtime performance of non-optimized builds is not good enough for them,
e.g. if they are  developing games.

That is why we have two configurations that affect how is a benchmark compiled:
- **Profile** Defines the used Cargo command.
  - `debug`: Corresponds to `cargo build`, uses the `dev` Cargo profile.
  - `opt`: Corresponds to `cargo build --release`, uses the `release` Cargo profile.
  - `check`: Corresponds to `cargo check`. Performs only type checking without code generation.
  - `doc`: Corresponds to `cargo doc`. Builds the documentation of the crate.
- **Scenario** Defines a compilation workflow.
  - `full`: Performs a non-incremental build, akin to setting `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0` (this is normally
  the default for `release` builds).
  - `incr-full`: Performs an incremental build, akin to setting `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=1` (this is normally
  the default for `dev` builds).
  - `incr-patched`: Performs a rebuild of a crate compiled with an incremental build, after performing
    some change to its source code. Each benchmark can define several `incr-patched` scenarios, corresponding
    to different changes being made (e.g. adding a comment, adding a `println!` call, removing a statement,
    etc.).
  - `incr-unchanged`: Performs a rebuild of a crate compiled with an incremental build, after no changes
    have been made to its source code. This scenario is not very practical in normal compiler usage,
    but it serves as a baseline for how fast can an incremental build be, if it doesn't actually
    need to perform any changes.

Unless a benchmark explicitly opts out of some profile or scenario, each benchmark is executed with
the cartesian product of all profiles and scenarios (except for the `doc` profile, which is executed
only once with the `full` scenario). In other words, we run each benchmark with many configuration
combinations (`profile=check + scenario=full`, `profile=opt + scenario=incr-full`,
`profile=debug + scenario=incr-unchanged`, etc.).

If I'm counting correctly, most benchmarks will be thus executed with ~13 configurations (some of them
may opt out of some configurations, or they can define more than one `incr-patched` scenario).
Furthermore, we execute each configuration three times (unless the benchmark reduces the number of
iterations to reduce benchmarking time). This means that most benchmarks are being compiled almost
fifty times during each performance analysis! For some of the larger benchmarks (e.g. `cargo`), it
takes several minutes until all the configurations are measured (and `cargo` is actually one of the
benchmarks that only performs a single iteration).

One important thing to note is that we only measure the performance of compiling the "leaf" (workspace)
crates. For example, the `ripgrep` crate has tens of dependencies. In our suite, we don't measure
the compilation of all these dependencies, we only measure the compilation of the final binary
crate/target. This makes the measurement more stable (and faster), but it also means that we can't
make a lot of conclusions about the end-to-end compilation performance of Cargo compiling large crate
graphs. Another approach or a different performance suite would be needed for that.

If you want to learn more about the benchmark configurations and other terms that we use when
talking about `rustc` benchmarks, you can find more information in the
[glossary](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/docs/glossary.md).

# Metrics
Now that we know what we want to measure (resources consumed by `rustc` when it compiles a Rust crate)
and we have seen how do our benchmarks look like, we should define what are the kinds of "resources"
that are interesting to us. There are actually many *metrics* that we gather when we benchmark an
artifact, you can find their list
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/43d16fe5da8b9a48c72a75dcc861f86f5dcf3823/site/src/comparison.rs#L231).
Some metrics are gathered by running `rustc` under the `perf` profiler, some come from the compiler's
built-in [self-profiling mechanism](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2020/02/25/intro-rustc-self-profile.html)
and some are measured externally (e.g. looking up the filesize of the built Rust executable on disk).

Below is a summary of the most important metrics that we take into account when compiling a
benchmark using a `rustc` artifact:
- Instruction count (`instructions:u`)[^perf-metric]: How many instructions were executed?
- Cycle count (`cycles:u`): How many CPU cycles were executed?
- Wall-time (`wall-time`): How long it took to compile the benchmark?
- Maximum memory consumption (`max-rss`): What was the highest amount of RSS (Resident Set Size)
of the `rustc` process? In other words, what was the maximum amount of RAM
occupied by `rustc` at any given moment during compilation?
- Binary size (`size:linked-artifact`): What is the size of the compiled executable (for binaries)
or the `.rlib` file (for libraries)? This metric is a bit tricky, because for libraries it doesn't
really mean "binary size" in the classical sense (because they are not binaries, duh), and this
sometimes confuses contributors. For libraries, this metric also included size changes of `metadata`,
the Rust-specific data used to exchange information between crates when compiling a crate graph.

[^perf-metric]: The `:u` suffix comes from `perf`, and specifies that instructions executed in the
    kernel are not included.

There are other metrics, like page faults, cache misses, branch mispredictions, etc., but these
are usually too low-level or too noisy for us to take into account, unless we analyse a specific
compiler change that is targeted to improve one of these metrics.

You might wonder why I only put `wall-time` as the third metric in the list above. Shouldn't it be
the most important metric? Indeed, the actual compilation time is the thing that we want to improve
the most, because it most affects the everyday workflow of Rust developers. However, it is also 
a very noisy metric, and it is notoriously difficult to use it for comparing the relative performance
of two programs (artifacts). The compiler is a very large program[^rust-size], and a single
change/commit/PR will usually not have an enormous effect on its performance. However, we still want
to be able to detect even relatively small performance changes, to avoid a death by a thousand cuts.
If we used wall time for such detections, we would be drowned in noise, unable to recognize small
performance perturbations.

[^rust-size]: Running [`tokei`](https://github.com/XAMPPRocky/tokei) on the `rust-lang/rust` repository
    tells me that the compiler itself has almost 600 000 lines of Rust code, and the standard library
    contains an additional 500 000 lines. And that's without the 200+ external Rust crate dependencies
    used by the compiler!

Therefore, we instead primarily usually use **instruction count** as the primary metric, because
it is quite stable (=resistant to measurement noise) and thus allows us to detect even relatively
small performance changes. It is also usually relatively highly correlated with wall time, which is
the ultimate metric for our needs. Sometimes we also take `max-rss`, `cycles`, binary size or other
metrics into account, if needed.

# How is the benchmark suite executed?
Now that we know about both the benchmarks and the metrics, it is time to talk about how do we actually
execute the benchmarks. It is done using the `collector` binary, which is
[implemented](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector) in the `rustc-perf`
repository. It contains various commands for executing the compile-time benchmark suite, but also for
profiling `rustc` on a specific benchmark to learn more about its behavior. It can profile the compiler
with various profiling tools, such as [`Callgrind`](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-manual.html),
[`Cachegrind`](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cg-manual.html), [`dhat`](https://github.com/nnethercote/dhat-rs)
or [`perf`](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page).

`rustc` developers can run the benchmarks locally with a custom build of the compiler, which can be used
to quickly judge the performance effect of local compiler modifications. However, such locally gathered
results might not always correspond to the actual performance profile of the compiler, because locally
built `rustc` versions usually do not contain the
[complex]({% post_url 2022-10-27-speeding-rustc-without-changing-its-code %})
[optimizations]({% post_url 2023-07-30-optimizing-rust-ci-2023 %}) that we perform on CI. Therefore,
benchmarks are usually performed on our custom benchmarking infrastructure.

The benchmarks are executed on a dedicated machine (which I will call *collector server*), whose
location is top secret[^kidding]. Its hardware parameters and software configuration can be found
[here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/docs/perf-runner.md).
The machine is set up in a way that tries to minimize environment noise. It has disabled Hyper-threading,
frequency scaling and ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization), and uses a few other configuration
options in an effort to keep the measurement results as stable as possible. We could perhaps still
go a bit further in tightening down the machine, but I feel like we're hitting diminishing returns
already, and I don't think that we could ever get to a point where we'd have so little noise that
e.g. the `wall-time` metric could be reliably used to detect small performance changes anyway.

[^kidding]: Just kidding (although I really have no idea where is that machine located :laughing:).

# Performance measurement workflow
Ok, so now we know how and where are the benchmarks executed, but how it all fits together? How does the
collector server know when and what to benchmark and how do the benchmark results find their way into
the perf.RLO website?
I'll try to explain it, but first, I want to describe a few terms:

- **Benchmark database (DB)** Postgres SQL database that stores the results of all benchmarks that
we execute, plus additional metadata needed to support our monitoring and benchmarking workflows. If
you're interested, the schema of the database can be found [here](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/database/schema.md).
- **Collector server** The dedicated machine that actually runs the benchmarks. It communicates with
the perf.RLO site and stores results into the benchmark database.
- **perf.RLO** Web service that facilitates communication of the perfbot, the collector server and
the benchmark DB. It also hosts a [website](https://perf.rust-lang.org/) with various dashboards
that are used by `rustc` developers to analyse the performance of the compiler.
- **Perfbot** GitHub bot that receives benchmarking commands from users and posts comments on pull
requests. It is deployed as a part of the perf.RLO server.

All of these components are implemented in the [`rustc-perf`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf)
repository.

Here is a diagram that shows the individual components and how do they communicate together:

![Diagram showing the Rust benchmark infrastructure](/assets/posts/rustc-perf/infrastructure.png)

> Icons for the diagram were sourced from [svgrepo.com](https://www.svgrepo.com).

I included "sequence numbers" in the diagram to hint at what can be the approximate order of the
displayed events and actions. Below I'll describe what is happening in more detail, by walking through
the whole workflow of benchmarking a single `rustc` artifact (a single *benchmark collection*):

1. **Creating a `rustc` artifact**
The first thing that has to happen when we want to measure the performance of some artifact (version
of the compiler) is that the artifact must be created. This usually happens in one of two ways:
   - A pull request is merged into the `master` branch of [`rust-lang/rust`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
   This launches a corresponding CI [job](https://github.com/rust-lang-ci/rust/actions/runs/5887977731/job/15968290261),
   which compiles a heavily (PGO/BOLT/LTO-)optimized build of `rustc`, which is then uploaded to a
   remote storage (S3 at the moment), and later downloaded by the collector server.
   After the recent [optimizations]({% post_url 2023-07-30-optimizing-rust-ci-2023 %}), usually around
   8-12 PRs are merged each day, and all of them have to be benchmarked.
   - We want to know if a specific pull request has any effect on the compiler's performance, before it
   is merged. In that case, we can instruct our merge-queue bot ([`homu/bors`](https://github.com/rust-lang/homu))
   to prepare a `rustc` artifact from the latest commit of the PR using a so-called *try build*. When
   a try build is performed, the PR is rebased onto the current `master` commit and built with all the
   CI optimizations, as if it was a merged commit. This try build is then again uploaded to remote
   storage and later downloaded by the collector server. Try builds can be triggered by posting a
   comment containing `@bors try` on a pull request (if your account has the appropriate permissions).
   
   Each artifact has a default *baseline (parent) artifact*, against which it is compared by default.
   For `master` artifacts, it is the preceding (parent) `master` commit, and for `try` artifacts it
   is the `master` commit upon which its PR was rebased. We can of course select a different baseline
   for comparison in the perf.RLO UI manually, if we want to.

   Note that currently we only benchmark artifacts built for the `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
   target, i.e. 64-bit Linux, which is probably the most common target used by Rust developers. We
   do not benchmark the performance of `rustc` on other platforms and operating systems.
2. **Queuing the artifact**
Once an archive with the compiled artifact is available for download, we need to add it to the
*benchmark queue*. For `master` commits, this happens automatically through
[unrelated Rust infrastructure](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/43d16fe5da8b9a48c72a75dcc861f86f5dcf3823/collector/src/lib.rs#L271)
that gets this data from GitHub. For `try` builds, users have to manually enqueue the build using the
`@rust-timer queue` command posted in a comment on the pull request of the try build.

    Queuing the artifact means storing it into the benchmark database. Once it is there, it will appear
    in the [status page](https://perf.rust-lang.org/status.html), which shows both the current queue
    and the artifact that is currently being benchmarked. There is a certain ordering of the queue,
    which is usually not that interesting. What is important is that we first benchmark the
    baseline/parent artifact of artifact `X` before benchmarking `X` itself, otherwise we won't have
    anything to compare against.

    > information, so I'm planning to [redesign](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1675)
    > it soon.
3. **Running the benchmark**
The collector server basically runs an [endless loop](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/collect.sh),
in which it queries the perf.RLO service, asking for the next artifact that it should benchmark. Once
it receives a response, it downloads the artifact archive (containing `rustc`, `cargo`, the standard
library, LLVM and all other toolchain components), extracts it and uses it to run the whole benchmark
suite. It continuously stores data into the database during the benchmark execution, so that the
benchmark progress can be observed on the status page, which reads the data from the DB. It also
records any possible compilation errors that sometimes happens e.g. when a PR breaks some functionality
of `rustc`. After the benchmark collection is finished, it notifies perf.RLO that it has finished,
and starts asking for the next artifact to be benchmarked.

4. **Posting the performance summary**
Once the benchmark collection has completed, the perfbot will perform an analysis of the performance
results, and create a short summary that compresses the most useful results into a few tables, which
are then posted as a [comment](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/114894#issuecomment-1681236006)
to the pull request associated with the artifact. If the analysis heuristics consider the change to
be a regression, it will mark the pull request with the `perf-regression` label, and it will hint to
the PR author that they might want to take a look at the performance results and potentially try to
do something about them. It will also ping the `wg-compiler-performance` group. Someone from the group
will then usually chime in, and either cooperate with the PR author to resolve the regression, or
consider the regression to be noise or to be acceptable and add `perf-regression-triaged` label to
the pull request, marking the regression as triaged.
5. **Analysing results in perf.RLO**
The posted summary comment contains several links pointing to the perf.RLO website, which contains
many useful views for examining the performance of `rustc`. Probably the most commonly used page is
the [comparison page](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html). It contains comparisons of results of
the individual benchmarks between the benchmarked artifact and its baseline/parent artifact. This
data can be filtered and further analysed with various summaries.

   The individual benchmark results also contain links to a
   [`detailed query page`](https://perf.rust-lang.org/detailed-query.html?commit=bd138e2ae11050ea9ca7a187345a1b606697a8db&base_commit=745efcc7d9b59d31674bf9445269924377019c5c&benchmark=regex-1.5.5-opt&scenario=incr-patched:%20compile%20one),
   which contains very detailed information about the benchmark execution, recorded by the compiler's
   self-profile machinery. While this information will probably only be grokkable by expert `rustc`
   developers, it is sometimes an invaluable tool to understand what exactly has caused the performance
   perturbation. The page also contains example commands which can be executed locally to display a
   difference between `Cachegrind` profiles of the two artifacts, which can be further used to analyse
   the performance changes.

And that's (mostly) it. This workflow is repeated several times each day, and serves as an invaluable
tool to help us monitor the performance of our beloved compiler.

# Decision policy
Apart from the technical details of how are the benchmarks executed, one important aspect of the
benchmarking process is also the decision-making policy which deals with performance regressions.
The performance aspect of (new) code in the compiler is quite important to us. If we find out that a
PR causes too large regressions before it is merged, it might be a reason to hold off the PR temporarily,
until we can find a way to reduce the regressions. Sometimes, regressions can even be the reason why
a PR is abandoned completely! If we only find out about the regression after the PR has been merged,
we can decide to either revert the PR completely, or ask its author (or someone else) to try to send
a PR that will hopefully resolve the performance issue.

Now, the question of course becomes: What is a "too large regression" and how do we recognize it?
I'm afraid that I don't have a perfect answer for that :man_shrugging:. Our infrastructure is quite
good at alerting us when *something* regarding performance changes, but then we still have to do
(at least) two more steps:
1. Decide if the change is noise or not. I'll talk more about noise below.
2. If we consider the change to be *real* (i.e. not just noise), decide if a regression is acceptable
or not.
   > Note that we generally consider *all improvements* to be acceptable :laughing: Although sometimes
   > it can still be valuable to examine why exactly has something been improved (when it wasn't

These two steps are fairly manual, and unless the regressions are truly large, usually someone from
the `wg-compiler-performance` or `compiler` teams (or the PR author) decides on their own whether
the regression is acceptable or not, based on the pull request contents. If the situation is more
complicated, more people usually chime in to the pull request and discuss the performance results
together.

Currently, the process is heavily based on judgement calls and experience -- people that are familiar
with the compiler often have a pretty good guess if a change is noise or not, or if a regression is
"small enough" so as not to warrant any further investigation or resolution. Sadly, this experience
is hard to transfer to new `rustc` contributors, which is something that we should strive to improve.

# Dealing with noise
One of the most limiting factors of introducing more automation into the decision-making process
of regression handling is the ever-present noise, which requires us (humans) to make judgement calls.
There are two main sources of noise that affect the results of compilation benchmarks:
- **Measurement noise** This is probably the first thing that comes into mind when "noise" is mentioned.
Some background process might execute a few instructions on the collector server while a benchmark
is being measured, or a kernel interrupt or context switch arrives at an unfavorable time, or someone
opens the window in the room where the machine is located, thus affecting the room temperature and
in turn possibly also the CPU's performance :sweat_smile:. This noise is what makes the `wall-time`
metric pretty much unusable for comparing small changes to the compiler. However, since we mostly
focus on the instruction count metric, which is relatively immune to this kind of noise, it is not
usually the main culprit.
- **Codegen noise** This one is perhaps a little less obvious, but it is actually quite devious.
Both `rustc` and LLVM contain many heuristics that perform decisions like:
  - Should this function be inlined?
  - Should this loop be unrolled?
  - What instruction should this IR (Intermediate Representation) construct be lowered to?

  These decisions can have a non-trivial effect on the runtime performance of the program being compiled,
  and they can also be quite "contagious" -- deciding to inline a single function can result in a myriad
  of other compiler analyses, transformations and optimizations suddenly being performed.

  Ok, but how does that concern us? Well, `rustc` is a program that is compiled with `rustc` (and
  LLVM). Therefore, if some of its (performance critical) functions are near a threshold of some
  heuristic, seemingly innocent and unrelated changes to its source code can make these functions go
  over (or under) that threshold, and thus alter the performance of `rustc` in a big way!
  You add an innocent `println!` line to one `rustc` function, and suddenly that function might not
  pass an inlining threshold and not get inlined, which can regress the compiler's performance.
  
  What's worse, if some part of the compiler is near such threshold, it's possible that it will go
  back and forth and oscillate around the threshold. This situation is quite annoying, and frequently
  causes "noise blips", where a benchmark suddenly regresses/improves out of nowhere, only to go back
  in the opposite direction a few commits later. Since these differences in codegen affect the amount
  of instructions executed by `rustc`, not even the (normally quite stable) instruction count metric
  is immune to this effect.

  Even though this phenomenon can happen for pretty much any non-trivial program, there is an additional
  second order effect in play here, because the final build of the compiler is compiled using its own
  source code (a ["stage-2 build"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUIjG-y4zaA)). Therefore, `rustc`
  source code changes can both directly affect its own codegen quality, and also the codegen decisions
  it makes when it compiles other Rust crates, both of which can have an effect on its compilation
  performance.

Encountering results that are (or look like) noise is sadly not uncommon. So what do we do when we're
not sure whether something is noise or not?
- Analyse the historical variance of the regressed metric/benchmark combination,
using [historical charts](https://perf.rust-lang.org/index.html). This helps us notice if there were
e.g. some suspicious "blips" in the recent history.
- Use the profiling machinery (usually `Cachegrind`) offered by the `collector` to compare execution
profiles between the two compared artifacts. These profile differences can often show us that a change
in instruction counts is benign and was caused by an uninteresting codegen difference.
- Ask [@lqd](https://github.com/lqd) :laughing:. He always seems to know exactly when some source of
noise has started occurring, and in general has an incredible insight into what is currently going on
with `rustc` PRs and their performance effects.

The perf.RLO site also has some built-in noise filtering that helps to combat noise. It uses simple
[statistical analysis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/docs/comparison-analysis.md)
based on historical data for a given metric/benchmark combination, which computes a *significance threshold*.
The more variance is present in the historical data (=the more noisy benchmark is), the higher the
threshold. If a change does not go above this threshold, it will be hidden by default in the
[artifact comparison page](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html), and it also will not be shown
in the PR comment with the performance measurement summary. This works relatively well, but even with
the threshold, noisy results still crop up from time to time (mostly because of codegen noise).

# Weekly triages
Apart from observing and reacting to the results of individual PR benchmark results, there is also
a periodical process called the "weekly triage". There is a roster of `rustc` developers who take
turns analysing all PRs that modified the performance of the compiler over the last week and preparing
a "triage report" that summarizes the compiler performance changes over that week. They also go
through PRs that caused regressions and decide to either mark these regressions as unimportant or
expected, or to ask the PR author to examine how could the regression be reverted.

The creation of the triage report is partially automated by `rustc-perf`, which generates a template
for the report using data from the benchmark database and GitHub. This makes the process much easier
for the person doing the weekly triage.

The weekly triage is then presented at the Rust [compiler team meetings](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings/topic/.5Bweekly.5D.202023-08-10/near/383654603)
on Zulip, and it can be also found in the
[This Week in Rust](https://this-week-in-rust.org/blog/2023/08/09/this-week-in-rust-507/#rust-compiler-performance-triage)
newsletter.

# Future
Before concluding, I'd like to mention a few things that are in the works for our benchmarking
infrastructure. I have already mentioned runtime benchmarks several times, which I will describe in
a future blog post, but there are also some other things on the horizon:

- **Parallel frontend** The Rust compiler is currently only multithreaded when performing code generation
using LLVM, otherwise it executes serially. There is an ongoing (and promising!) effort to parallelize
also the "frontend" part of the compiler (parsing, macro expansion, type checking, type resolving,
linting, etc.), which could provide further speed-ups. However, it might also require some rethinking
of how we perform the benchmarks, e.g. by introducing some new configurations (like the number threads
used for compiling) or by adding new profiling methods that would help us better analyze multithreaded
performance.
- **Alternative codegen backends** Another ongoing effort that promises to speed-up compilation (but also
perhaps modify/improve the runtime performance of Rust programs) is the development of different
"codegen backends" (other than LLVM). The most developed backends at the moment are the
[`Cranelift`](https://github.com/bjorn3/rustc_codegen_cranelift) and [`GCC`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc)
backends. Once these backends can be used as a reasonable replacement for LLVM (and once they are
integrated into our CI, so we can easily distribute them to end users and the collector server), we
might want to introduce another configuration option for the benchmarks, which would allow us to test
compilation performance using different codegen backends.
- **Multiple collector servers** The current collector server sometimes struggles to keep up, especially
since we now merge more PRs per day, and each benchmark collection is slower because of the newly
added runtime benchmarks. We might eventually hit a point where we will need to distribute the benchmarking
across multiple machines, which will further complicate the whole infrastructure and make us deal
with things like managing noise and different hardware parameters across different machines.

# Contributions are welcome!
Nothing that I have described in this blog post is set in stone! There are a lot of things that can
still be improved, modified or streamlined. Contributing to `rustc-perf` can be perhaps less intimidating
than jumping directly into the compiler, since it's not such a massive piece of code, and it is relatively
self-contained.

It also contains contribution opportunities in many different areas! Sometimes we need to write
[SQL queries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1657), implement a
[CLI command](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1691) in Rust, improve our
[statistical analysis](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1489) algorithms, or modify a web
frontend written [in Vue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pull/1689). There is something for
everyone, so if you would like to try to contribute to it, don't hesitate to contact me, or ask around
in the [`t-compiler/performance`](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/247081-t-compiler.2Fperformance)
Zulip stream :)

# Conclusion
There is a lot of other details and things that I have not mentioned or glossed over in this post
(and even then it's quite long :sweat_smile:), but I hope that I got the gist of our benchmarking
process across. I think that the way in which Rust developers monitor the performance of the compiler
is quite cool, and I'm happy that I have the opportunity to be a part of it, and to
[contribute](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/pulls/kobzol) to making the process better.

If we want to keep making the compiler faster and faster, having (and maintaining!) infrastructure
for monitoring its performance is a necessary component. And it seems to be paying off - since one
year ago, the performance of the compiler has actually improved [quite a lot!](https://perf.rust-lang.org/compare.html?start=2022-08-17&end=2023-08-17&stat=instructions%3Au).

efforts, let me know on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/15ukro3/exploring_the_rust_compiler_benchmark_suite/).
